Test Plan for School Management System
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the test plan for the School Management System (SMS), covering functional, non-functional, and security testing.
The goal is to ensure the system meets the defined requirements and operates as expected.
1.2 Scope
This test plan covers all modules within the SMS, including:
Student Management
Staff Management
Course/Class Management
Fee Management
Attendance Management
Library Management
Exam Management
Report Card Generation
Communication Module (e.g., parent-teacher communication)
Administrative Dashboard
1.3 System Overview
Briefly describe the system's architecture, key functionalities, and target users (e.g., administrators, teachers, students, parents).
2. Test Strategy
2.1 Testing Levels
Unit Testing: Individual modules and components will be tested independently.
Integration Testing: Verify the interaction and data flow between different modules.
System Testing: Test the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): End-users (administrators, teachers, etc.) will test the system in a real-world environment.
2.2 Testing Types
Functional Testing: Verify that the system performs as expected according to the requirements.
Non-Functional Testing:
Performance Testing: Evaluate system performance under different loads and user scenarios.
Usability Testing: Assess the ease of use and user experience.
Security Testing: Identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
Compatibility Testing: Verify compatibility across different browsers, devices, and operating systems.
Reliability Testing: Assess system stability and uptime.
Regression Testing: Re-execute previously passed tests to ensure that new changes or fixes have not introduced new bugs.
3. Test Environment
3.1 Hardware and Software
Specify the hardware and software configurations for the test environment (e.g., servers, databases, operating systems, browsers).
3.2 Test Data
Define the types of test data to be used (e.g., real-world data, synthetic data, boundary value data).
Ensure data privacy and security during testing.
4. Test Schedule
4.1 Test Phases
Define the start and end dates for each testing phase (unit, integration, system, UAT).
4.2 Milestones
Identify key milestones and deadlines for test execution and reporting.
5. Test Deliverables
5.1 Test Reports
Detailed reports on test execution, including test cases, test results, defects, and risk assessments.
5.2 Test Summary Report
An overall summary of the testing process, including key findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
6. Test Metrics
6.1 Defect Density
Number of defects found per unit of code or functionality.
6.2 Test Coverage
Percentage of code or requirements covered by test cases.
6.3 Defect Resolution Rate
Speed and efficiency in resolving identified defects.
7. Risk Management
7.1 Risk Identification
Identify potential risks that could impact the testing process (e.g., schedule delays, resource constraints, technical issues).
7.2 Risk Mitigation
Develop strategies to mitigate identified risks (e.g., contingency plans, risk-based testing).
8. Roles and Responsibilities
Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the test team members (e.g., test lead, testers, developers).
9. Tools
List the testing tools to be used (e.g., test management tools, defect tracking tools, performance testing tools).
10. Appendix
Include any supporting documents, such as:
Requirement documents
Design documents
Test case templates
Important Considerations:
User Stories: Base test cases on user stories to ensure that the system meets the needs of end-users.
Accessibility: Ensure the system is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen readers, keyboard navigation).
Data Integrity: Verify the accuracy and consistency of data throughout the system.
Maintainability: Ensure the system is easy to maintain and update in the future.

Test Case Example
Test Case 1: User Login
Test Case ID: TC-001
Test Title: Verify User Login with valid credentials
Preconditions: User is registered in the system.
Test Steps:
Open the login page of the School Management System.
Enter a valid username and password.
Click the “Login” button.
Expected Result: User should be successfully logged into the system and redirected to the dashboard.
Postconditions: User is logged in and has access to the dashboard.
Status: [Pass/Fail]
