# **Test Plan for School Management System**  
**Prepared By:** Kiflom Berihu  

## **1. Introduction**  
### **1.1 Purpose**  
This document outlines the test plan for the **School Management System (SMS)**, ensuring that all functional, non-functional, and security aspects of the system meet defined requirements. The goal is to validate system performance, usability, and security while identifying and resolving defects.  

### **1.2 Scope**  
This test plan covers all modules within the SMS, including:  
- **Student Management**  
- **Staff Management**  
- **Course/Class Management**  
- **Fee Management**  
- **Attendance Management**  
- **Library Management**  
- **Exam Management**  
- **Report Card Generation**  
- **Communication Module** (e.g., parent-teacher communication)  
- **Administrative Dashboard**  

### **1.3 System Overview**  
The **School Management System (SMS)** is a web-based platform designed for educational institutions. It enables **administrators, teachers, students, and parents** to efficiently manage academic and administrative tasks. The system consists of a **centralized database, a web-based user interface, and role-based access control.**  

---

## **2. Test Strategy**  
### **2.1 Testing Levels**  
The testing process follows a structured approach with multiple levels:  
- **Unit Testing**: Individual components/modules are tested in isolation.  
- **Integration Testing**: Verify the interaction and data flow between different modules.  
- **System Testing**: Validate the entire system against functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: End-users (administrators, teachers, etc.) validate the system in a real-world environment before deployment.  

### **2.2 Testing Types**  
#### **2.2.1 Functional Testing**  
- Verify system functionalities according to requirements.  
- Validate role-based access control (e.g., student vs. teacher permissions).  

#### **2.2.2 Non-Functional Testing**  
- **Performance Testing**: Assess response time, scalability, and system behavior under various loads.  
- **Usability Testing**: Evaluate ease of navigation and user-friendliness.  
- **Security Testing**: Identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and unauthorized access.  
- **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure system compatibility across browsers, devices, and operating systems.  
- **Reliability Testing**: Assess system stability and uptime under different conditions.  
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure new changes do not introduce defects in previously working functionalities.

## **3. Test Environment**  
### **3.1 Hardware and Software Requirements**  
- **Hardware**:  
  - Server: Minimum **8GB RAM, 250GB SSD, Quad-Core Processor**  
  - Client Machines: **4GB RAM, Web Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)**  
- **Software**:  
  - Operating System: **Windows/Linux/MacOS**  
  - Database: **MySQL/PostgreSQL**  
  - Application Server: **Apache/Tomcat/Nginx**  
  - Development Framework: **Django/Laravel/Node.js (as applicable)**  

### **3.2 Test Data**  
- **Real-World Data**: Sample student records, courses, and grades.  
- **Synthetic Data**: Boundary values, invalid inputs, and special characters.  
- **Data Privacy Considerations**: Use anonymized or masked data for testing.
